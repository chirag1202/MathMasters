# MathMasters

A Flutter-based math learning application for kids.

## Project Structure

- `mathmasters/` - Main Flutter application directory
- `releases/` - APK releases generated by CI/CD pipeline
- `.github/workflows/` - GitHub Actions CI/CD configuration

## CI/CD Pipeline

This repository includes an automated CI/CD pipeline that builds and commits APK files on every merge to the main/master branch.

### How It Works

1. **Trigger**: The pipeline runs when:
   - Code is pushed to `main` or `master` branch
   - A pull request is merged into `main` or `master` branch

2. **Build Process**:
   - Sets up Java 17 and Flutter 3.24.0
   - Installs project dependencies
   - Builds a release APK for Android

3. **APK Storage**:
   - APKs are stored in the `releases/` directory
   - Two files are created per build:
     - `mathmasters-<timestamp>.apk` - Timestamped version
     - `mathmasters-latest.apk` - Always points to the most recent build

4. **Auto-commit**: The pipeline automatically commits the generated APK files back to the repository

### Getting the Latest APK

Download the latest APK from the `releases/` directory:
- `releases/mathmasters-latest.apk` - Most recent build

### Local Development

For local development and testing, see [mathmasters/README.md](mathmasters/README.md).

## Building Manually

To build the APK manually:

```bash
cd mathmasters
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

The APK will be located at: `mathmasters/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
